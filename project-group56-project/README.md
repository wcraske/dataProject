## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

The National Hockey League has provided this data set. Which has been compiled to be easily digestible by Drew Hynes, who created this to â€œ make it easier for stat nerds.
In this dataset, we have included many statistics such as the ice time for each player and goalie, the amount of goals scored by players, whether said goal was scored on a power play, if the goal was a winning goal, as well as which goals were scored on specific goalies.
Our data was collected over the span of two years, from 2015 to 2017. The purpose of our dataset is to find the likelihood or trend of scoring when on a power play or down a player, compared to whether it's the winning goal, as well as to find the goalie which has the most amount of powerplay saves, compared to the worst amount of regular season saves. Overall, just for general public interest. This data was initially derived from a public portion of the NHL API.

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

We hope to analyze certain trends about specific goalies, and whether they are consistent in their goaltending, and to find the likelihood of scoring on a power play, while comparing it to whether it was the winning goal. We hope to present this information with graphs and other forms to provide an interesting and digestible analysis of trends. We are interested in this topic since both of us have played hockey since childhood. The dataset found also provides copious amounts of data which are interesting to analyze and have interesting specificities, such as ice time per player. Given time, I would hope we are able to build a user-facing Dashboard with this dataset.
